# Jupyter Lab Notebooks to create Oracle Docker Images and their testing.
These various Jupyter Lab Notebooks are focused largely around the Oracle Database and Docker. These notebooks will  document how I build out my Oracle Database environments to test new features. The notebooks cover the following areas

* Install of Jupyter Lab for use with Oracle and Docker and as a result Python, pip and virtual env.
* The creation of an Oracle Docker image from within Jupyter Notebooks using Python and Docker APIs
* The creation and of a Oracle Docker Container using the image created in the previous step again using Python and Docker APIs
* The creation of a standby database
* Installing a docker "swingbench" image to run against the created databases

I'm not saying this is the best or only way to do this... I use this method because it's simple, self documenting and trivial to change.

Happy to recieve feedback on how to improve the flow or any mistakes I've made.
